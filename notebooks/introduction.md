## Code vs. Software

For the purpose of this primer, and in many scientific domains, all code is considered software. While creating software fundamentally involves writing code, software development encompasses many other critical tasks, such as design, maintenance, and infrastructure management, among others. Software is, therefore, much more than just code. This book introduces principles and best practices from software development that can serve as a framework for creating robust code. By adopting these practices, we can shift from a "single script" or "collection of scripts" paradigm to one where software is findable, usable, and reusable with minimal effort.

That said, the "single script" or "collection of scripts" paradigm still has its place. Many scientists can address their research questions by implementing equations, statistical analyses, or various functions in a few scripts that reliably produce the desired outcomes. In such cases, a straightforward coding approach may be entirely sufficient. However, we encourage readers to reflect on which pieces of code have the potential to evolve into softwareâ€”potentially increasing their dissemination and usefulness to a broader audience.

The following articles provide insightful discussions on the complexities of code and software in science and offer recommendations for improving current practices.

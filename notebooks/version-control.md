# Version Control

## Git

## Git Repository Services

There are several companies offering git repository services and platforms that provide version control and code management tools.
All of them are very similar offering almost the same suite of features with slightly different user experience. Among the common features they offer are:

- Codebase storage
- Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)
- Issue tracking
- Built-in security
